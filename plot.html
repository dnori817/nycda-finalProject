						<h2>DIRECTOR</h2>
						<h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000682/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Paul Verhoeven</a></h3>
						<img class="dirphoto" src="img/pv.jpg">
						<p>Paul Verhoeven graduated from the University of Leiden, with a degree in math and physics. He entered the Royal Netherlands Navy, where he began his film career by making documentaries for the Navy and later for TV. In 1969, he directed the popular Dutch TV series, Floris (1969), about a medieval knight. This featured actor Rutger Hauer, who has appeared in many of Verhoeven's later films. Verhoeven's first feature, Diary of a Hooker (1971) (trans. "What do I See?"), was released in 1971. However, it was his second, Turkish Delight (1973), with its combination of raw sexuality and a poignant story-line, that gained him great popularity in the Netherlands, especially with male audiences. When his films, especially Soldier of Orange (1977) and The 4th Man (1983), received international recognition, Verhoeven moved to the US. His first US film was Flesh+Blood (1985) in 1985, but it was RoboCop (1987) and, especially, Total Recall (1990) that made him a big box office success. Sometimes accused of portraying excessive violence in his films, Verhoeven replies that he is only recording the violence of society. Verhoeven has co-scripted two of his films: Soldier of Orange (1977) and Flesh+Blood (1985). He also directed an episode of the HBO Deadly Nightmares (1983) TV series. Several of his films have been photographed by Jost Vacano, including the hit cult film, Starship Troopers (1997), starring Casper Van Dien.</p>

					<h2>THE MOVIE</h2>					
					<div id="rev-txt">
      <p><img src="img/1.jpg" width="453" height="262" class="p3">A cybernetic organism, or cyborg as they are more commonly  known, is a fusion of living tissue and machine. The cyborg’s construction  represents a synthesis of reality and fiction, the real and the imagined  amalgamated into a single being. By its very nature, the cyborg is a physical  embodiment of irony, two opposites working together in a solitary manufactured  form. How appropriate then that Paul Verhoeven’s film <em>RoboCop</em>, while an exciting and rousing action picture, also happens  to be a clever satire on dehumanization through technological advancements, and  in that the resubjectification of humanity as a complete organism through its  mechanization and industrialization. Released in 1987, <em>RoboCop </em>embraces a bold and bloody preview of a fascist future in  its science-fiction genre touches, but underneath the fantastical and  actionized scenario exists a humorous discussion about how modern society  defines humanity. Through sharp and comical observation, Verhoeven’s view of America caricatures  extreme evolutions in capitalism, media influence, desensitization to violence,  gentrification, and our perception of heroes, each in service of a greater  conversation about identity and culture. Although easily overlooked as a  product of 1980s excess entertainment, the film remains a thoughtful and  influential cultural commentary. </p>
      <p>Before exploring the film, let us first consider the cyborg  itself and how it relates to human identity, as these theories will inform the  later discussion of <em>RoboCop</em> as a  major cultural reflector. The term “cyborg” was first conceived in 1960 by  scientists Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline, who imagined a human being  whose body would be enhanced by technology to survive in the realms of outer space  without need of a space suit. From this conception and further hypothetical  scientific analyses emerged countless science-fiction writings, from the  engineered Replicants in Philip K. Dick’s <em>Do  Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? </em>to the cybernetically enhanced species  the Borg in <em>Star Trek: The Next  Generation</em>. Also emerging were several considerations of the cyborg as a  reflection of the late twentieth century (and beyond) way of life. In her essay <em>A Cyborg Manifesto</em>, a rethinking of  feminism through the metaphor of a cyborg, sociologist Donna Haraway observes  “The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity.  It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. No longer  structured by the polarity of public and private.” Haraway argues that the  cyborg in popular culture reflects the interplay of materialism and idealism, the  duality of modern society, and the search for understanding one’s self as a  body and identity. The cyborg is an incorporation of countless, and in some  cases untraceable, stimuli that join together to form a confused whole.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><img src="img/2.jpg" width="453" height="262" class="p2">As part animal and part machine, the cyborg’s world and  existence share in the natural and invented. Anyone who wears glasses, survives  from a pacemaker, has pins to repair a fractured bone, uses a hearing aid, or  requires any other medical device to function or survive is a cyborg, both part  of the natural world and supported by technology. Without these sometimes  small, sometimes considerable medical advancements, the broken down physicality  of their users would signify the shell of person, nonfunctional or busted,  incomplete, less than human. Curious then that we are not “complete” or  “functional” without the support of some artificial do-dad to enhance our  physical state beyond what Nature intended for us. Nature, as it would seem, is  not human by modern definitions. A simulation of humanity completed by a  medical device, however, results in a person becoming more human than a person  with an obvious defective body part or biological process. Our acceptance of  these commonplace medical cyborgs suggests that our modern definition of  humanity has been distanced from <em>natural</em> humanity. In turn, cyborgs cling to their human components and strive to offer  a reproduced vision of what it means to be human; any trace of human authorship  is clung to, desperately. But this is self-deception that denies the corruption  which occurs through a process of human interpretation by way of technological  application. When so many of us are cyborgs, the cyborg can no longer be viewed  as part human, part machine, and in no part whole; rather, it must be seen as  the modern definition of humanness. Anything beyond a cyborg is impossible  idealism, as purity is a contradictory notion in defining one’s identity. </p>
      <p><em>RoboCop </em>is the  story of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a policeman in the ruinous dystopia of Detroit. On his first patrol  with fellow officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), he engages a sadistic gang led by  crimelord Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Murphy is shot to pieces and  soon pronounced dead. Meanwhile, the chairman of conglomerate Omni Consumer  Products (OCP), known as the Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy), wants to begin  construction on a citywide overhaul to create a utopian “Delta  City”, but the first step is ridding Detroit of its unruly  criminal element. Top executive Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) pitches an “urban  pacifier” enforcement droid called ED-209, which is riddled with glitches. But  young shark Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) suggests his “robocop” program as an  alternative, a cyborg design ready for testing “as soon as some poor schmuck  volunteers.” Murphy’s remains become the spare parts for RoboCop, his memory  seemingly erased and replaced with programmed law enforcement Directives: 1) Serve  the public trust, 2) Protect the innocent, and 3) Uphold the law. A fourth  directive appears on RoboCop’s first-person viewscreen but remains classified.  When he’s unleashed on Detroit,  his robotically unswerving sense of duty creates a media sensation that leads  to a decrease in crime and a police force that fears being replaced by machines.  But RoboCop is not the perfect machine his creators intended; inside linger  Murphy’s memories of his former family and violent death. </p>
      <p><img src="img/3.jpg" width="453" height="262" class="p3">Recognizing her late partner, Lewis confronts RoboCop and  asks his name, but when he cannot respond she says, “Murphy, it’s you.” An  outpouring of memories flow into RoboCop’s head, and all at once he seeks out  Boddicker and arrests him, inciting Boddicker’s confession that he’s on Jones’  payroll. Though Murphy wants to strangle his killer, RoboCop’s programming  doesn’t allow it. Instead, he hauls Boddicker downtown for booking, and then he  confronts Jones and plans to arrest him only to discover Directive 4, a measure  which prevents RoboCop from arresting any OCP executive. Jones retaliates with  ED-209, arranges the release of Boddicker to have Morton killed, and orders the  police to destroy RoboCop. Badly damaged and barely escaping with the help of  Lewis, our hero repairs himself and reveals to Lewis that a part of him is  still Murphy. He wonders where his family is, and she explains that Murphy’s wife  and son have left town, believing him dead. Together, RoboCop and Lewis take  down Boddicker’s crew. Afterward, RoboCop confronts Jones in a board meeting  attended by the Old Man, exposing Jones’ association with Boddicker and his attempt  at a hostile takeover of OCP. The Old Man responds directly by firing his  company’s traitor and therein quashes Directive 4, which permits RoboCop to  kill Jones. His life and company just saved, the Old Man asks our hero, “Nice  shootin’ son, what’s your name?” RoboCop replies, “Murphy.”</p>
      <p>Originally, screenwriters Ed Neumeier and Michael Miner set  out to write the story of a robot cop, inspired by <em><a href="bladerunner.asp">Blade Runner</a> </em>(1982, based on Dick’s aforementioned book) but more  so by Marvel Comics’ “space knight” superhero Rom, a robotic alien soldier whose  “humanity” is transferred within the housing of bionic armor (several issues of  Marvel’s <em>ROM: Spaceknight </em>can be seen  throughout the film). Their story demanded a human element and soon moved away  from a robot cop and developed into the story of a cyborg. And since Orion  Pictures had already experienced great success with cyborgs on James Cameron’s <em><a href="terminator.asp">The Terminator</a></em>, they agreed to release  the film. Several directors were approached but few could get beyond the film’s  title; the name “RoboCop” sounded corny and absurd, like countless other  low-budget action movies from the 1980s. When the script came to Dutch director  Paul Verhoeven, whose first English-language film <em>Flesh+Blood </em>(1985) was also released by Orion, he threw it away  thinking it “rubbish”, until his wife picked up the script and, in reading it,  realized layers of social commentary and satire were underneath the basic  action movie scenario. Verhoeven agreed to make the film and months of  preparation commenced, largely based around how special FX artist Rob Bottin (whose  work on John Carpenter’s 1982 stunner <em><a href="thing.asp">The  Thing</a></em> was already renowned)would  achieve the RoboCop suit and armor. </p>
      <p><img src="img/4.jpg" width="424" height="304" class="p2">Casting Murphy required a thinner actor to fit in the  RoboCop suit and so initial prospects such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael  Ironside were eliminated in favor of Peter Weller, star of the 1984 cult flop <em>The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the  8th Dimension! </em>To prepare, Weller trained extensively alongside an  instructor from Juilliard’s movement department to master his character’s hulking  robotic motions. But the design of the RoboCop suit would be argued over for  months before the look was approved. Bottin’s original rounded and aerodynamic designs  were very much similar to the final design, harkening back to the robotic icon  Maria from Fritz Lang’s <em><a href="metropolis.asp">Metropolis</a></em> (1927). But several members of the production, Verhoeven included, felt the  suit should be more angular and futuristic, like Japanese robot designs.  Bottin’s design eventually won out, as it more than the others reflected the  humanness of the subject within. The sleek look of RoboCop’s suit, made of black  Kevlar and purple-touched metals, appears robotic enough, but the lower half of  Weller’s face is exposed and, along with the actor’s subtle physical movements,  suggests the human trapped beneath this cold exoskeleton in understated  displays of emotion and hesitation. For the rest of his cast, Verhoeven went  against type by hiring Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith, both known for “nice guy”  roles, to play the film’s central villains. Nancy Allen also changed her image  from Brian De Palma’s strawberry curlicued sexpot (in <em><a href="carrie.asp">Carrie</a></em>, <em>Home Movies</em>, <em>Dressed to Kill</em>, and <em><a href="blowout.asp">Blow Out</a></em>) to a tough, short-haired,  completely desexualized cop. </p>
      <p>Under Verhoeven’s ambitious helm, the challenging technical  production went over-budget and over-schedule, but featured dozens of in-camera  effects and remarkable visuals, which to this day are nothing short of  astonishing. The shoot took place in Dallas, and  Rocco Gioffre’s flawless matte paintings complete a futuristic image of Detroit with tall  skyscrapers and an expansive cityscape. Stop-motion animation was used to  achieve the ED-209 sequences, while Bottin’s makeup work outside of the RoboCop  suit was tested to its limits. In Murphy’s gristly death sequence, his hand is shockingly  blown to mush by a shotgun blast; the cop then takes a bullet to the head in a camera  swoop that begins facing Bottin’s convincing Murphy anamatronic straight-on,  and then rotates around to witness the blowback. Another impressive Bottin scene  features one of Boddicker’s goons (Paul McCrane) doused by toxic waste; the  resultant mutation, Bottin’s designs inspired by Rick Baker’s makeup FX on <em>The Incredible Melting Man </em>(1977), sags  along until a car strikes him, and his head and body burst over the windshield  like overfilled water-balloons. Technical expertise aside, Verhoeven’s necessity  for over-the-top violence to denote the film’s satiric elements earned <em>RoboCop</em> an X-rating from the MPAA upon  initial screenings, requiring several reductions in bloodshed and gore before  it was granted an R-rating. When it was finally released, critical reception  was overwhelmingly positive and the $13 million production earned more than $53  million in box-office receipts. The next year, <em>RoboCop </em>was Oscar-nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing, and  also won a “special achievement” Oscar for its Sound Effects Editing. Over the  next decade, the film’s success produced an increasingly dull franchise  consisting of two sequels (in 1990 and 1993), several television series (both  live-action and animated), videogames, comic books, and a 2014 remake—none of  them as sharp as the original. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="img/5.jpg" width="453" height="262" class="p3">In the initial review by its staff, <em>Variety</em> observed “<em>RoboCop</em> is as tightly worked as a film can be, not a moment or line wasted.” How  completely accurate. Every aspect of the film works in unison, the characters,  plotting, music, editing, and production efficient and economic in their  service of the overall story. Verhoeven does not lose himself in the film’s  tempting technophilia; rather, he carefully places moments of riotous irony  throughout to reflect the warped conditions of the film. From the first images  of <em>RoboCop</em>, Verhoeven immerses us in  newscasts (by Leeza Gibbons and Casey Wong) about the state of this aggressive,  militarizing world. Their news is presented with a smile while contrastingly  graphic reports on the alarming geopolitical climate flash on our screen.  Verhoeven allows the viewer to grow immersed in the story’s dystopia, but he also  asks that we step back and reflect on that world with these newscasters and  their nightly stories, interrupted occasionally by mock-commercials. One such  commercial, a spoof of Milton Bradley’s <em>Battleship</em>,  is called “Nuke ‘Em” and parodies escalating Cold War tension between the  United States and Russia; another for “The Family Heart Center” sells the best  in mechanized body parts by listing off the technical specs for designer heart  transplants—the spokesperson adds “and remember, we care” almost as an  afterthought. Verhoeven would use a similar device to distance and parody his  film’s extreme world in <em><a href="starshiptroopers.asp">Starship Troopers</a> </em>(1997); that entire film is presented as piece of ironic, interactive  pro-war propaganda (“Would you like to know more?”). </p>
      <p>As a character, RoboCop is very much a product of his ironic  world, and that world serves as a cyborg metaphor, a construction of irony  itself. Haraway argues that cyborgs are “the illegitimate offspring of  militarism and patriarchal capitalism,” and this description fits <em>RoboCop</em>, a film steeped in an intentionally  exaggerated dose of Reagan-era politics and capitalistic drives. Early in the  film, we learn the massive corporation OCP has purchased and privatized the  Detroit Police Department if only to test experimental weaponry that would  later be sold to a larger contractor: the American military. But their “urban  pacifier” ED-209 is just another ineffectual hunk of American machinery, not  dissimilar from and certainly mirroring the American automotive industry once  so prevalent in the film’s setting of Detroit.  As if to save a dying man by replacing parts of him with machines, OCP’s  ultimate mission is to tear down old Detroit and rebuild it into “Delta City”,  to repair the crumbling sprawl into a better, superior metropolis through the  process of gentrification—out with undesirables, in with the elite—which itself  is an act of identity reformation not unlike the creation of a cyborg. Indeed,  even the villains plotting the film’s vast conspiracy represent cyborg relations,  the ironic assembly of savage criminals teamed with a high-class capitalist to  form a company of villains—the pairing of base humanity in Boddicker’s sicko  gang with the technological capacity of Dick Jones and his impressive (albeit  faulty) ED-209. Each aspect of <em>RoboCop </em>as  a story takes a contradictory shape and therein defines itself as the very  subject of the film: the ironic cyborg. </p>
      <p><img src="img/6.jpg" width="453" height="262" class="p2">Given the cyborg’s conflicted state, Robocop cannot help but  be a sympathetic, if not a tragic construction weighted by his lingering  humanity—very much like Frankenstein’s monster after he realizes that he’s an  abomination of Nature. Furthermore, Verhoeven, ever fascinated with Christian  symbolism, sought to depict Murphy’s journey from cop to RoboCop in a Christ-like  metamorphosis, from his arms-outstretched Crucifixion in his bloody death to  his Resurrection from the dead some days later, renewed in body and soul.  Verhoeven even injected a scene in the millworks finale where it appears as  though RoboCop walks on water. Such potent symbolism unconsciously enhances our  hero’s effect as an iconic, emblematic image. But RoboCop is less a deity than  a metaphor for post-modern humanity. Saddening scenes follow Murphy as he  returns to an empty home, on Primrose    Lane no less, to find it empty and populated only  by memories of his once-happy life. As RoboCop, Murphy and his mechanization  signify our own “loss of innocence in our origin,” our conflicting ideals about  what it means to have a specific gender, race, or sexuality—an identity. The  cyborg’s physiological overhaul reflects the post-modern human being, as  through our own politicization, social relations, and physical manipulation by  artificial means, humanity has been redefined and distorted to such an extent  that it’s impossible to conceive what it means to be “human” anymore. We are  all ironic, layered constructions searching for that spark of purity within us,  and perhaps this is why Murphy remains so relatable, because he finds it.</p>
      <p>Through ultra-violence, hilarious satire, fascinating robotics,  impressive special FX, and the production’s incredible visual presentation,  Paul Verhoeven made a cultural commentary that is still relevant today, if not  more so given our culture’s increasing reliance on and shaping by technology. <em>RoboCop </em>is a singularly thoughtful  action film, more than any action picture called <em>RoboCop </em>has any right to be. It considers the process of redefining  and “improving” the identity of a thing by transforming it through perceived  advancements, and how that process, while certainly a development of a kind,  also denies the origins of the reformatted subject. This is the equally  destructive and creative course of humankind, a trajectory beset by the  developmental myth that progress denotes improvement. The film acknowledges our  acceptance of the human identity’s technological integration as normalcy, but  also recognizes the importance of origins, the humanity underneath the metal  sheen. Through the course of this cautionary tale about technology, RoboCop is  no longer viewed as a machine but a man, just as valid as any other man, if not  more so because of Murphy’s now exceptional physicality and distinctive flair  for law enforcement. Murphy’s eventual conquest of his technological self is a  victory for humanity in the modern age; but, as with most aspects of <em>RoboCop</em>, our hero’s victory is  satirical. Murphy’s is a victory in which the faintest human traces are  celebrated as a triumph to ironic effect; his recollection of incomplete  memories and his human face stretched thin over a robotic body are not a  victory, but a harsh yet comical reflection of a cyborg culture ever redefining  itself through technology. </p>
